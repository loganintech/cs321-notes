## What

* _What can computers do? What can't they do?_
* The course starts on simple machines, and moves towards more complicated ones

## Why

* Learn what they can and can't do
* Improving proof-writing skills
* _Hopefully_ learn to appreciate proofs

## Challenges

* The class is abstract
* The class is rigorous (formal definitions, and many proofs)

| Low Level (Easy to Reason About) | High Level (Easy to Program) |

| DFA                              | C++                          |
| NFA                              | Python                       |
| Turing Machines                  |                              |
| Context Free Grammar             |                              |
| Regular Expressions              |                              |
