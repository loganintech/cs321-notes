# Nondeterministic Finite Automata

```
D from DFA means Deterministic

Deterministic Property:
For language {0, 1}, every state has exactly 1 outgoing path for each character
```

What happens remove the restriction of __exactly one__ next step.

Def: An NFA (Nondeterministic Finite Automata) is like a DFA but no restriction on output paths.

Ex:

Runs:
```
1 --a-> 1 --b-> 1 --b-> 1
1 --a-> 2 --b-> 3 --b-> 4
```
Guess: So char 2nd to last is 'a'?

every time there is a choice, NFA "just guesses", NFA accepts if there is some set of guesses that leads to accept state

eg:

{a, ab, aab, abba}* designing the dfa: all strings we get by concatenating (any # of copies) of these 4 strings

Ex:

{ w (\0) | w is not multiple of 3 }

E - {0, 1, \0}

= { x | backwardsE w == x = w \0, and w is a M(3) }

_Note: There's no one correct way to represent a DFA_

E = {0, 1}

A DFA:

Without the dead state, this would be an NFA

An equivalent yet larger DFA:

## automata --> automaton is singular


Small refresh:

```
M = (Q, E, sigma, s, F);
where Q is set of state, E is alphabets, signma is transition fn, s is start state, and F is final set of states.
```

In state p and read character 'c' S(p, c) is the set of possible states to transition to.

Signifies: At least 2 a's followed by at least two b's
